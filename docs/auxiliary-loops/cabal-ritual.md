# Cabal Ritual Loop

This loop is really only useful for playing around Trinisphere, but is totally necessary as it is the only ritual we have that can always be mana-positive with a trinisphere in play.

## Requirements 

* [Koziland](../fundamental-loops/koziland.md) (1 land and 1 titan being the only thing in the library)
* Cabal Ritual in hand
* Mana to cast Cabal Ritual

## Procedure

1. From the Koziland state, generate 8 draw triggers on the stack with a shuffle trigger on top
1. Discard 5 nonland cards
1. Cast Cabal Ritual
1. Resolve the shuffle and all 8 draws
1. Repeat for limitless black mana

We can then continue with standard combos as the increased costs don't matter anymore.
