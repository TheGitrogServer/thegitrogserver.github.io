<h1>Dakmorless loam dredge loops</h1>

<h2>Preface:</h2>

These are new Dakmorless infinite mana loops with crop rotation and gaea's cradle utilizing sculpting the deck to ensure hitting a titan when dredging and thus shuffling your gy in your library. This method allows you to shuffle in your graveyard without adding another card to your yard/library. We also use life from the loam to manage the amount of cards in your graveyard and library. 

<h2>Requirements:</h2>

* As this is a Darkmorless line we are assuming you emptied your library with Tainted Pact, as this is the only reliable way of doing so without Dakmor.
* The gitrog monster in play
* Any discard outlet in play
* A total of four creatures in play
* G mana available with at least one land in play
* Graveyard with N nonland cards in it
* Enough lands in hand
* All other referenced cards in hand

<h2>Procedure:</h2>

<h3>I. Setting up, getting gaea's cradle into play</h3>

1. Cast crop rotation sacrificing a land
2. Holding priority on the draw you discard titan
3. Resolve draw
4. Discard cradle and other land(s) until you draw your remaining library
5. In response to crop rotation on the stack discard titan
6. Resolve crop rotation finding Gaea's cradle and activate for GGGG

<h3>II. Determining the road to determinism</h3>

This section was made to easily navigate through different parts of the setup so you can get to the shortcuttable loop as soon as possible. The amount of cards in the library will be shortened to L from this point on as they are necessary to determine whether or not you can start shortcutting.

**Is L divisible by 3 after activating gaea's cradle for GGGG ?**

* Yes:

  Move on to the next question.
  
* No:

  Move on to section III 'Setup loop'

**Is L more than 3?**

* Yes

Move on to section IV 'Non-deterministic dredge loop'

* No

Move on to section V 'Deterministic dredge loop' 

<h3>III. Setup loop (adds a card to library)</h3>

1. Chain land discards until you have drawn your library
2. Discard titan to shuffle
3. Chain land discards until you have drawn your library again
4. Cast life from the loam targeting 3 lands in your graveyard
5. Discard titan to shuffle
6. Cast crop rotation sacrificing gaea's cradle
7. Resolve draw from crop rotation, chain land discards to empty out library
8. Discard titan 
9. Resolve crop rotation finding gaea's cradle activating for GGGG

After resolving this loop return to section II 'Determining the road to determinism'

<h3>IV. Non-deterministic dredge loop (not shortcuttable)</h3>

In this section you will have to loop multiple times without shortcutting. You will need to loop the following dredge loop to acquire a certain amount of mana to be able to move over to a shortcuttable version. The amount of mana needed should be (L-2)*2 and after that you're going to need one more G to cast a crop rotation. 

1. Discard life from the loam
2. Discard a land
3. Replace the draw trigger with a dredge 3 from life from the loam
4. If all 3 dredged cards are lands discard life from the loam and repeat step 3 until you dredge a titan creating a shuffle trigger
5. Resolve the shuffle first and then the draw from dredging a land and then continue to empty out your library by discarding lands
6. Cast life from the loam targeting 3 lands
7. Discard titan to shuffle gy in your library
8. Cast crop rotation sacrificing gaea's cradle
9. Resolve the draw and continue to discard lands until library is empty
10. Discard titan
11. Resolve crop rotation searching for cradle

After getting to the amount of mana necessary you're going to need to remove lands from your graveyard/library. 

1. Discard life from the loam
2. Discard a land
3. Replace the draw trigger with a dredge 3 from life from the loam
4. If all 3 dredged cards are lands discard life from the loam and repeat step 3 until you dredge a titan creating a shuffle trigger
5. Resolve the shuffle first and then the draw from dredging a land and then continue to empty out your library by discarding lands
6. Cast life from the loam targeting 3 lands
7. Discard titan to shuffle gy in your library
8. Empty your library by discarding lands
9. Cast life from the loam targeting 3 lands
10. Keep repeating step 7-9 until the only cards in your graveyard are life from the loam and a single land
11. Discard titan to shuffle titan life from the loam and the land in your library
12. Cast crop rotation sacrificing gaea's cradle
13. Resolve the draw and then empty out your library by discarding lands
14. Discard titan to shuffle
15. Resolve crop rotation searching for cradle
Move on to V 'Deterministic dredge loop'.

<h3>V. Deterministic dredge loop (shortcuttable)</h3>

1. Discard life from the loam
2. Discard a land
3. Replace the draw trigger with a dredge 3 from life from the loam which will be a titan and two lands.
4. Resolve the shuffle first and then the draw from dredging a land and then continue to empty out your library by discarding lands
5. Cast life from the loam targeting 3 lands
6. Discard titan to shuffle gy in your library
7. Cast crop rotation sacrificing gaea's cradle
8. Resolve the draw and continue to discard lands until library is empty
9. Discard titan
10. Resolve crop rotation searching for cradle

Looping these 10 steps will net you an infinite amount of green mana which can be filtered to black by continuing to loop but by replacing all instances of gaea's cradle with a black producing land. These loops can be shortcutted and you can move on to section VI 'Looping spells'.

<h3>VI. Looping spells</h3>

Before you can loop spells you need to clear your library/graveyard of extra lands. You can do this by using life from the loam as it removes 3 lands, while needing only 1 to draw it back.

1. Chain your lands so that your library is empty and your graveyard is full of lands
2. Cast loam to get back 3 of those lands
3. Discard our titan 
Repeat steps 1-3 until life from the loam is the only card in your graveyard

From this state (life from the loam being the only card in your graveyard and no cards in library) we can move on to loop spells:

1. Cast the spell you want to loop (use assassin's trophy as an example)
2. Discard titan to shuffle loam, trophy and titan in library
3. Discard 3 lands to draw library
4. Cast life from the loam on the 3 lands you discarded
