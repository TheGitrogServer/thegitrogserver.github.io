# Finale of Devastation

The easiest way we have to win a game is by going to combat with a pumped Finale of Devastation giving all our creatures haste and +x/+x. The haste is important here, as it means we can still do this even if we started the turn with just one creature in play.

This isn't really a loop, all you have to do is play out enough creatures to hit each opponent with at least one, then cast Finale with X greater than the highest life total, attack, win.
