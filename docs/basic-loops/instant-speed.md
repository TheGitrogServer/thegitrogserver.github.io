# Basic Instant-speed Loop

This loop is particularly useful if you’re going off over the top of other instant-speed interaction.

## Requirements 

* A discard outlet in play
* Empty graveyard and library
* Unbounded mana
* An arbitrarily large number of draw triggers on the stack (viä [Koziland](./koziland.md))

## Procedure

1. Cast [*instant*], resolve the [*instant*]
1. Discard a titan, resolve shuffle trigger
1. Resolve 2 draw triggers

You are now back at your initial board state after having cast an instant spell.
