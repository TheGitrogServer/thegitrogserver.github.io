# Drawing the Library

Although the setup to draw your library will always be the same, there are a few different veins in which you can execute this. Each of them has their benefits, and here we will detail two of them. They are identical until just before actually drawing the library.

## Requirements

* A discard outlet in play
* The Gitrog Monster in play
* Dakmor Salvage in hand

## Procedure

* Discard Dakmor Salvage to your discard outlet, triggering The Gitrog Monster.
* Resolve the draw trigger, choosing to replace the draw with Dakmor Salvage’s dredge.

Two cards have hit the yard the moment you chose to dredge and have one of six configurations:
1. Two non-lands
1. Two lands
1. One land and one non-land
1. One land and one shuffler
1. One non-land and one shuffler
1. Two shufflers

Note: ”shuffler” refers to either Kozilek, Butcher of Truth, Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre, or Gaea’s Blessing

If 1: No triggers, discard Dakmor Salvage again.

If 2 or 3: A Gitrog trigger goes on the stack - discard Dakmor Salvage in response.

If 4: A Gitrog and shuffler trigger each go on the stack - resolve shuffler first, then discard Dakmor Salvage with the draw trigger still on the stack.

If 5 or 6: A shuffler trigger goes on the stack - let it resolve then discard Dakmor Salvage again. Note: This is a normal procedure. If this occurs upon your first dredge of Dakmor Salvage after a shuffle then you must dredge again until you hit a land and draw a card before letting the shuffle resolve.

## Worst Case Scenario

Configuration 6 occurs immediately after each shuffle, every time, and you end up drawing lands off of each Gitrog trigger until the library is devoid fewer than three lands (and all the non-lands).

The solution is to discard all but a few lands to repeatedly Dredge and shuffle. Repeat this process if we continue assuming the worst-case scenario until your graveyard and/or library is just lands and shufflers. If you draw your Eldrazi Titan during this process then simply discard it. Once your library is devoid of anything but lands and shufflers, you can dredge Dakmor Salvage until you generate enough draw triggers to draw the rest. To resolve any excess draw triggers, you can either discard nonland cards followed by a titan, or you can repeatedly discard a titan to resolve them one at a time.

To dissipate any draw triggers leftover once you finsih stacking and draw your library, just discard a titan and draw it until the stack is empty.
