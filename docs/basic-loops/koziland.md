# Koziland

Koziland loops were first popularized by Leptys, and are the basis of almost all the loops we currently use in the deck. The general process is to enter what is called the Koziland state; a land and a titan in your library, with nothing in your graveyard.

Entering this state is simple enough:
1. Discard a titan, resolve shuffle trigger
1. Discard a land, resolve draw trigger
1. Discard the titan again, resolve shuffle trigger

From here, Koziland loops are those which rely on stacking several draw triggers by discarding and dredging <span class="mtg-card">Dakmor Salvage</span>. When you dredge Dakmor in this state, you'll have two triggers to put onto the stack, and can stack them so that the shuffle resolves first. This allows you to respond to the draw just created by doing it again.
