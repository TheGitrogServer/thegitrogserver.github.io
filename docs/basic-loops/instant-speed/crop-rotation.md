# Crop Rotation Loop

Looping Crop Rotation is a very useful tool to get access to many different resources, especially for getting green mana at instant speed. Use this line first if you are attempting to go off at instant speed and have at least two creatures in play.

If you do not have Gaea's Cradle, whether by Forbidden Tutor or budget, you may also use Twilight Mire in conjunction with Dark Ritual. Refer back to the Lotus Petal section to loop Ritual by casting it in step seven rather than cracking Petal. In this way you make boundless black mana. If you have another green leftover, that black mana can be filtered to green by activating Mire during Crop Rotation loops rather than Cradle.

## Requirements

* An empty deck and graveyard
* One green mana
* A total of two or more creatures in play

## Procedure

1. Discard a land, holding priority on the draw trigger
1. Discard a titan, resolve the shuffle only
1. Discard and dredge Dakmor, stacking the draw trigger under the shuffle, and resolve the shuffle trigger only
1. Repeat step 3 until there are six draw triggers on the stack
1. Resolve two draw to draw your land and titan
1. Discard any nonland card
1. Discard a titan, shuffle
1. Discard Gaea's Cradle
1. Cast Crop Rotation, resolve the draw trigger, but hold priority on the spell
1. Discard a titan, shuffle
1. Resolve Crop Rotation, finding Cradle
1. Resolve two draw triggers
1. Discard a titan
1. Resolve two draw triggers
1. Tap Gaea's Cradle for >GG

Repeat these steps to yield boundless green mana, sacrificing Cradle to Crop Rotation while discarding a random land in step 8 in future cycles. To make black mana, just switch out Cradle for a Swamp.
