# Assassin’s Trophy Loop

This is generally the first thing you should do after making mana. The process to loop this is much the same as with Lotus Petal, but with a step changed to casting Trophy.

## Requirements

* Empty stack, graveyard, and library
* Boundless mana

## Procedure

1. Discard any land, holding priority on the draw trigger
1. Discard a titan, and resolve the shuffle trigger
1. Discard and dredge Dakmor, stacking the draw trigger below the shuffle and resolve the shuffle trigger only
1. Discard and dredge Dakmor, stacking the draw trigger below the shuffle again, but hold priority on the shuffle trigger
1. Cast Assassin's Trophy
1. Resolve the shuffle trigger and all three draw triggers

Repeat this to destroy all permanents. This process can be used with any instant and will be detailed further in the Koziland section of the combos.
