On 2024-04-09 there was an apparently fraudulent [Reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveEDH/comments/1bzwo2p/official_wotc_cedh_is_happening_lemoras_cards/) (imagine my surprise) stating that: *"Today we got huge news about official cEDH tournaments backed by Wizards of the Coast. cEDHPT, a European tournament organizer, just announced that they have plans with WotC for officially backed Commander tournaments in the near future."*

So I contacted my dear friend Toby Elliott to ask him if he and Wizards were going to finally address the unique problems that The Gitrog Monster causes, and the genneral issues with sanctioned Commander.

Here was his response
> I think the recent news that Wizards has tacitly endorsed cEDH is probably massively overblown and is setting people up for a lot of disappointment. I will note that Wizards has not said anything about this.
> Nobody has asked me about updating the MTR for multiplayer play, and my advice based on years of writing tournament policy is that trying to do so is basically a disaster waiting to happen. If I was trying to design a format that was unenforceable when taken seriously, it would look a lot like Commander.
> Sorry if that's not what you wanted to hear, but it's not that I have inherent objections, it's that we figured out it was basically impossible years ago and that's part of why Commander is focused on social play, where it works OK.

I replied
> No I sincerely appreciate the response and that is honestly what I expected to hear.
> I suppose that does clarify the (lack of) direction regarding things like the definition of "the game state" and what constitutes a progression there-in. Also bizzare edge cases about shuffling a commander into the deck and then casting it face down without knowing whether it is a commander, etc
> The only thing I am a little disappointed by is I was hoping Magic's honorary L4 (you) would finally *have* to address the interaction of The Gitrog Monster, Dakmor Salvage, and the Cleanup Step.
> But I guess you've successfully dodged that bulletâ€¦ For now.

He replied
> Hehe. I think you have to start with the problem that collusion is entirely legal and likely the best way to win before you go anywhere else. That's not fixable, really
